            In this lab you will automate the process of verifying a web application's functionality from end to end (as opposed to one method at at time). You will also create performance tests to see how well your application works under load.

            The instructions in this lab are divided in two sections. In the first section you use Selenium Core and Selenium IDE to record and execute end-to-end functional tests. In the second part you will use JMeter to record and invoke performance tests and to measure the performance of the application.
        </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="web-test-functional-tests"></a>2.1.&nbsp;Create Functional Tests With Selenium</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Before recording any tests let's take a look at Selenium Core and Selenium IDE. 
            </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4269"></a>2.1.1.&nbsp;Selenium Core</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Navigate to <code class="filename">src/main/webapp</code> where you'll see the Selenium Core distribution. Selenium Core needs to be installed on the same website as your application, because of JavaScript's "Same Origin Policy" intended to prevent the loading of scripts from multiple domains. You will use Selenium Core to executing functional test cases and test suites recorded in HTML files. To look at a sample test suite, open <code class="filename">src/main/webapp/tests/TestSuite.html</code>. You will see a table containing a single "dummy" test case called "Foo Test". Let's look at how we can load it in the Selenium Test Runner.
                </p><p>
                    Click and drag the project to the SpringSource tc Server. Open a Firefox browser and enter the path to the Selenium Test Runner:
                    </p><pre class="programlisting"><a href="http://localhost:8080/webtest/selenium-core-1.0.1/core/TestRunner.html" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/webtest/selenium-core-1.0.1/core/TestRunner.html</a></pre><p>
                    You should see the following:
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/SeleniumTestRunner.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Selenium Test Runner</p></div></div><p>
                    This is the Test Runner. In the top left corner you can enter the path to the test suite relative to the URL of the Test Runner. Enter the following path: <code class="filename">../../tests/TestSuite.html</code> and press Go. This should load the test suite with "Foo Test" but since the test doesn't exist a 404 error will appear in place of the test case. Now let's take a look at the Selenium IDE, which can be used to record tests.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4298"></a>2.1.2.&nbsp;Selenium IDE</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    In the Firefox browser, open a new tab and enter the path to the application:
                    </p><pre class="programlisting"><a href="http://localhost:8080/webtest" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/webtest</a></pre><p>
                    Next click on the Tools menu, and pick Selenium IDE. You should see the Selenium IDE:
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/SeleniumIDE.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Selenium IDE</p></div></div><p>
                    You will use Selenium IDE to record and save functional tests as HTML files.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4316"></a>2.1.3.&nbsp;Create a Functional Test For Searching Accounts</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    By default when Selenium IDE it is in recording mode. To verify that find the red record button on the right and move the mouse over it. You should see a tooltip that says "Now Recording". If not click it to begin recording.
                </p><p>
                    Back in the main browser window click on Accounts. Notice how Selenium IDE recorded two commands: "open | /webtest" and "clickAndWait | link=Accounts". Open means open the specified URL while clickAndWait means click on the link with the specified value and wait for the page to reload.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            While recording feel free to look at the values Selenium IDE creates. However if you click on one of the commands keep in mind the next thing you do will insert new commands at that point. Typically you'll want to scroll down to the bottom below the last command to make sure new steps are added to the end.
                        </p><p>
                            Also at any point while recording you can right-click the recorded commands and select "Clear All" to start over.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    Now that we're on the Account Search page let's add an assertion. Right-click on Account Search and choose "assertTitle Account Search". Look at Selenium IDE to see that it added the appropriate assert command. You should add at least one assertion whenever a new page is loaded to guarantee the successful transition. 
                </p><p>
                    Next enter 'a' in the Search String field and press Search. That will take you to the search results. Since this is a page reload add another assertion, this time for the Search Results page. When done right-click "Next" at the bottom and choose "verifyElementPresent nextUrl" to verify the presence of that link. 
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            Unlike an assertion, a verification does not fail the test case but simply records the error. It's common to create a single assertion per page and then follow up with a number of verifications. This is a nice balance between stopping a test vs. recording as many errors as we can without stopping.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    Following the same step as for the "Next" link, add a verification for the "Change Search" link. Lastly right-click at least one name of the results (e.g. "Dollie R. Adams") and select verifyTextPresent Dollie R. Adams. We have sufficiently verified the current page and are ready to move on.
                </p><p>
                    Click Next to get to the next page. As before, add  assertions for the page title and for the name "John C. Howard" in the search results.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            If we were using Ajax to load the results you would typically point Selenium to some part of the page that will be refreshed via Ajax and tell it what to look for. For example you might, right-click the first name in the results "John C. Howard" and choose "waitForTextPresent John C. Howard".
                        </p><p>
                            Why do this? If you don't do this, the Test Runner may execute the steps faster than it takes for the Ajax request to complete, causing the test to fail. That is why you need to tell Selenium to wait and what to wait for.
                        </p><p>
                            Note that it is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessary to do so in this test, however, as we don't do any Ajax loading at this time.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    Lastly click on the link for the details of "John C. Howard", and then press the red button in Selenium IDE to end the recording session. 
                </p><p>
                    Use the "Play Current Test" green button to play the entire test sequence one more time and make sure it runs without errors. Assuming it does use the File menu to save the test case to 
</p><pre class="programlisting">
  C:\spring-web-&lt;version&gt;\spring-web-&lt;version&gt;\web-test
 \src\main\webapp\tests\SearchAccounts.html
</pre><p>
		        </p><p>
                    The test has now been recorded and saved and is ready for execution with the Test Runner. 
                </p><p>
                    Go to the STS workspace, find the <code class="filename">src/main/webapp/tests</code> directory, and refresh it. It should contain the SearchAccounts.html file you saved from Selenium IDE. Next open <code class="filename">TestSuite.html</code> and replace Foo Test with the newly recorded Search Accounts test. When this is done go to the Firefox browser, select the tab with the Selenium Test Runner, and refresh the page. You should now see the Test Suite with the Search Accounts test:
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/SeleniumTestRunnerWithTestCase.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Selenium IDE</p></div></div><p>
                    Press the Run All Tests button in the top right corner and watch the Test Runner execute the tests.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4372"></a>2.1.4.&nbsp;Create a Functional Test For Editing an Account</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    The process for creating the next functional step is very similar. See if you can create it on your own. Here is a sample sequence of steps:
                    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Click on Accounts</p></li><li><p>Search for 'Keith'</p></li><li><p>Press Edit</p></li><li><p>Modify the account data</p></li><li><p>Save</p></li></ol></div><p>
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            Use 'File' - 'New Test Case' in Selenium IDE to record the new test
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    When you are done recording and verifying the test case save it in the same directory where the other test was saved. Add the new test case to TestSuite.html, go back to the browser tab with the Selenium Test Runner, and refresh the page. The suite should now contain two test cases. You can execute them if you like. They should run successfully.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4398"></a>2.1.5.&nbsp;Create a Functional Test For New Rewards</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Lastly use Selenium IDE to record a test for creating a new reward. The steps should be apparent by now. 
                    After completing this step you're ready to move on and create some performance tests as well.
                </p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="web-test-performance-tests"></a>2.2.&nbsp;Create Performance Tests With Apache JMeter</h3></div></div></div><p>
                Apache JMeter can be used to simulate a heavy server load and to analyze overall performance under different load types. It is possible to simulate different usage scenarios and it is important to create tests that are as close to real application traffic as possible. For example you can use server request logs to analyze production traffic before coming up with a performance test plan. In this lab we will assume there are 3 usage scenarios - browsing accounts, editing accounts, and creating new rewards. You will soon see how to vary the load amount for each usage scenario.
            </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4408"></a>2.2.1.&nbsp;Start JMeter</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Go to <code class="filename">c:\spring-web-{version}\jmeter-&lt;version&gt;\bin</code> and start JMeter using <code class="literal">jmeter.bat</code>. You should see an empty screen like this one:
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/jmeter-start.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Default Jakarta JMeter screen</p></div></div><p>
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4428"></a>2.2.2.&nbsp;Create a Skeleton Test Plan</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    A test plan is the root element of a JMeter project. It is common to begin filling it out by adding one or more Thread Groups. You can think of Thread Groups as categories of users, each one using the application in a specific way. 
                </p><p>
                    Right-click Test Plan on the left, select Add, and then Thread Group. Click on the newly created thread group and change its name to "Browse Accounts Thread Group". Create two more thread groups called "Edit Accounts Thread Group" and "New Reward Thread Group". 
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4435"></a>2.2.3.&nbsp;Prepare to Record Tests with JMeter</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    JMeter can act as a browser proxy and record requests while you're using the browser. This is a very convenient way of building up a test plan. Let's set up to use it.
                </p><p>
                    First we need to tell Firefox to use a proxy. In Firefox go to the Tools menu and select Options. In the preferences menu choose Advanced and then press the Network tab. Click the Settings button and then set up a manual proxy for localhost and port 9090 (Be sure to remove localhost from the field labeled "No Proxy For" if it is there!)
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/FirefoxProxySettings.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Firefox Advanced Network Preferences</p></div></div><p>
                    Now Firefox will send all requests through localhost:9090 but they will fail unless there is an actual proxy at that address.
                </p><p>
                    Return to JMeter, right-click WorkBench (on the right-hand side), select Add - Non-Test Elements - HTTP Proxy Server. Set the port to 9090 and set the "Target Controller" to the Thread Group you created. Next, press the Add button below "URL Patterns to Include" and type the pattern .* to make sure all requests are recorded. Next, press the Add button below "URL Pattern to Exclude" and add .*.css, .*.js, .*.png, and .*.gif. Your settings should be similar to the ones on the picture below.
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/JMeterHttpProxyServer.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: JMeter HTTP Proxy Server Settings</p></div></div><p>
                    You are now ready to start JMeter's proxy. Use the Start button at the bottom to start it.
                </p><p>
                    Browse a few pages of the application in the browser, return to JMeter and make sure they've been recorded as steps under the "Browse Accounts Thread Group". Once you've verified recording works move on to the next step.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            If you don't see anything getting recorded, try closing and reopening the Test Plan.
                            This will force JMeter to refresh its contents.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4468"></a>2.2.4.&nbsp;Record a Performance Test For Browsing Accounts</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Select all steps recorded so far and remove them through the right-click menu. The real fun is about to begin. Just remember you can always remove any recorded steps and repeat them in the browser as necessary.
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox click on Accounts, enter 'a' in the search string field and press Find. Go back to JMeter. See the two recorded requests. Right-click the "Browse Accounts Thread Group" and add a logic controller of type Random Controller.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            Logic controllers allow you to exercise recorded steps in different ways such as by looping over requests, interleaving them, invoking them in a random order, and so on.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p> 
                        Select the second recorded request (the one doing the actual search) and use Ctrl+X to cut it. Select the Random Controller item and use Ctrl+V to paste into it three times. You now have three instances of an account search request executed in a random order. Click on each request and change the searchString parameter to 'a', 'john', and 'keith' respectively. Finally click on Random Controller and rename it to "Search Random Controller".
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox click on Accounts, enter 'a' in the search string field and press Find. On the search results page press Next once and return to JMeter. Create a second Random controller under "Browse Accounts" and call it "Pagination Random Controller". Cut the last recently recorded link and paste it 3 times into "Pagination Random Controller" (you can discard the other recorded steps). You now have three instances of requests paging through search results executed in a random order. Click on each pasted link and change the "page" parameter to 1, 2, and 3 respectively so they're each going to a different page of the result set. 
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox click on an account to navigate to the Account Details page. Use the browser back button and visit a few more accounts. Return to JMeter and add all newly created steps under a 3rd random controller called "Details Random Controller".
                </p><p>
                    To make things more interesting and more realistic add an Interleave Controller directly under the "Browse Accounts Thread Group" and then cut and paste the 3 random controllers making them children of the Interleave controller. What you now have is a Browse Accounts thread group, which mixes (via interleaving) random requests for searching, paging, and showing account detail pages.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4485"></a>2.2.5.&nbsp;Execute a Load Test</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Click on the Browse Accounts thread group, change the number of threads (users) to 30 and set the loop count to Forever. Based on these settings the load test will start up to 30 concurrent requests adding one each second (the ramp-up period) and looping until you tell it to stop.
                </p><p>
                    One more thing is left before running. We need to be able to view the results. Right-click on Test Plan and add a listener of type Aggregate Report. Make sure Aggregate Report is the currently selected item and then go to the Run menu and select Start. As the tests ramp up the report will begin showing the results. The test will continue running until you stop it through the Run menu. Feel free to do so at any time and then examine the final results. You will see various numbers such as minimum and maximum time for a request, the median, the average, and the 90% line. Just keep in mind that average can be a very misleading number and it's usually better to watch the median or the 90% line to get an idea of what most users experience. Throughput is another important performance metric.
                </p><p>
                    Now that you're done with the Browse Accounts thread group, right-click and disable it before moving on to the next test.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e4494"></a>2.2.6.&nbsp;Record a Performance Test for Editing Accounts</h4></div></div></div><p>
                    Go to the HTTP Proxy Server under Workbench and change the target controller to "Test Plan &gt; Edit Accounts Thread Group". This will ensure recorded steps will now appear under the Edit Accounts thread group.
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox navigate to an account, make a change to it and save it. Use the browser back button to go back and select another account. When you've edited 3 or 4 different accounts you can stop. That's all we need for this group.
                </p><p>
                    Return to JMeter and click on "Edit Accounts Thread Group", change the number of threads (users) to 20 and the loop count to Forever. Use the Run menu to launch the load test for a bit. After a little while stop the test and check the results. When you're satisfied right-click and disable this thread group before moving on to the final step.

                    By now you've hopefully gotten the hang of creating JMeter tests. There are two unexpected issues that arise when recording JMeter tests against Web Flow. 
                </p><p>
                    The first issue is that Web Flow is stateful and needs to store values in the HTTP session. By default servlet containers store the jsessionId in a cookie but since we're simulating users from the same machine we also want many different cookies. Fortunately JMeter has built-in support for that. Right-click "New Reward Thread Group" and add a config element of type "HTTP Cookie Manager". The Cookie Manager ensures each simulated client request doesn't have to share its cookies with any other requests (seems like a good idea any time we talk about any kind of cookies).
                </p><p>
                    The second issue has to do with dynamic parameters such as Web Flow's execution key. It changes from request to request and cannot be hard-coded in the test scripts. To deal with this in JMeter we need to use a Post Processor element to parse a server's response, extract the dynamic value and parameterize subsequent requests with it.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            This is a problem we did not encounter with Selenium. Unlike JMeter Selenium runs as a bot inside the browser and does not need to record actual request parameters. Instead Selenium records user actions such as typed values, mouse clicks, and others. It then lets the browser submit additional dynamic values such as Web Flow's execution key.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    Let's illustrate how to record a Web Flow test by example. In Firefox click on New Reward. Return to JMeter and verify there are two requests. The first is the New Reward link, the second is a client-side redirect containing the execution parameter. 
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            Remember that by default Web Flow does a client side redirect on every request.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    Right-click the first request and add a new Post Processor of type "Regular Expression Extractor". Its settings should look like this:
                    </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="images/web-test/RegularExpressionExtractor.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1: Regular Expression Extractor</p></div></div><p>
                    This post processor uses a regular expression to extract the "execution" parameter value from the server response, saves it as a variable called "execution" so it is then available for use to subsequent requests. Click on the second request and modify the hard-coded execution value with ${execution}.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            In terms of the actual regular expression, (.*) creates a single grouping. The template $1$ then accesses that grouping. That's what the value of execution is set to.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox fill out the dining information, press Reward and return to JMeter. Click on the 3rd request and insert another Regular Expression Extractor. The extractor should have identical settings as the one above. Click on the fourth recorded request and replace the hard-coded execution value with ${execution}.
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            Note that if this call had been an Ajax request, you would additionally set the "Response Field to check" to Headers.
                        </p><p>
                            When an Ajax request results in a client-side redirect, Web Flow returns a normal HTTP response (200) but sets an HTTP response header field called "Spring-Redirect-URL" to the actual redirect URL. A JavaScript handler provided by Spring detects that and decides how to handle it.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                </p><p>
                    In Firefox press the Confirm button to complete the flow and return to JMeter. Click on the last request and notice it needs a confirmationNumber. This is also a dynamic value and cannot be hard-coded. Click on the previous request, insert yet another Regular Expression Extractor similar to the first ones but this time extracting a confirmationNumber parameter. When this is done click on the last request and replace the hard-coded confirmationNumber value with ${confirmationNumber}.
                </p><p>
                    Finally, check the URLs for the GET requests in this flow. Anytime an execution parameter is included, you will need to replace it with the dynamic ${execution} parameter.
                </p><p>
                    You are now done preparing the New Reward test script. Run the test once through the Run menu with a single user and check the Console in STS to make sure there are no exceptions. If you see any Web Flow exceptions they might be because of incorrectly extracted parameter values. If you don't see any exceptions click on the "New Reward Thread Group", set the number of threads to 10 and the loop count to Forever.
                </p><p>
                    Click on the other two thread groups and enable them. Click on each group one at a time and verify the number of threads (users). You should have 30 account browsing users, 20 account editing users, and 10 creating new rewards. You're welcome to change these values as you wish. When ready run the tests one last time, all of them together. Remember to monitor the results through the Aggregate Report item. In addition to Aggregate Report there are also other listener and post-processor elements that allow recording and showing results in different ways. Feel free to experiment if you have any time left.
