            This lab is split into two sections.
			In the first section, you will become familiar with RewardsOnline use case that is a good candidate for implementing as a web flow.
			Next, you'll set up the infrastructure needed to execute flows inside the application.
        </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="webflow-getting-started-flow-background"></a>2.1.&nbsp;Background</h3></div></div></div><p>
				The RewardsOnline application used in this lab consists of a mix of free and controlled navigation.
				Users may freely search accounts to view and edit.
				They may also be guided through a controlled process to create new rewards.
			</p><p>
				Such a controlled "New Reward" process is a good use case for a Web Flow.
				This process takes place over a series of steps and executes independently of other users.
				In this section, you will see how the New Reward flow should be invoked by users of the RewardsOnline application.
			</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2829"></a>2.1.1.&nbsp;Starting the New Reward Flow from RewardsOnline</h4></div></div></div><p>
					A new navigation menu item has been added to the RewardsOnline application that should start the New Reward flow when selected.
					You will review this new feature in this step.
				</p><p>
					First, deploy the <code class="code">webflow-getting-started</code> project to the server.
					Access the the application at <a href="http://localhost:8080/webflowgettingstarted" target="_top">http://localhost:8080/webflowgettingstarted</a>.
					Notice the <code class="code">New Reward</code> link in the navigation menu.
					Select it, and note it fails with a 404.
					This is because no handler has been registered for that resource URL; web flow, Controller, or otherwise.
					In fact, the Web Flow system has not been set up at all.
					In the next section, you will configure Web Flow and then map a new flow definition to the <code class="code">/rewards/newReward</code> resource.
					The flow itself will initially be blank.
					Do not worry, you will implement its logic later, for now it is just important to understand how flows get registered.
				</p><p>
					When you are comfortable with how the flow should be invoked from the RewardsOnline application, move on to the next section.
				</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="webflow-getting-started-flow-system-setup"></a>2.2.&nbsp;Web Flow System Setup</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Now you understand what the RewardsOnline application should be able to do: allow users to create a new reward when they access <code class="code">/rewards/newReward</code>.
				In this section, you'll set up the Web Flow System and learn how to register flows for execution.
				By the end of this section, you should understand how to configure Spring Web Flow inside Spring MVC.
			</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2858"></a>2.2.1.&nbsp;Add one-time system configuration</h4></div></div></div><p>
					Web Flow requires some one-time configuration to set it up.
					You must define two central Web Flow services, and a couple of adapters to plug it into the Spring MVC pipeline.
					You will do all that in this step.
				</p><p>
					First, inside <code class="code">webflow-config.xml</code> define a <code class="code">flow-executor</code> element with id <code class="code">flowExecutor</code>.
					This is the central flow execution engine.
					It has a number of configuration options, but just use the default configuration for now.
				</p><p>
					Next, define a <code class="code">flow-registry</code> and wire it with your <code class="code">flow-executor</code>.
					This is where you register your flows that can be executed.
					Each flow is assigned a unique id when registered, and flow ids are mapped to resource URLs.
					You will see how to register flows later, for now just focus on getting the flow-registry bean defined.
				</p><p>
					Next, you will register adapters that plug Spring Web Flow into the Spring MVC DispatcherServlet pipeline.
					These adapters allow Spring MVC to map requests for certain resources to flows.
				</p><p>
					The first adapter allows a Web Flow to be a Spring MVC request handler, just like a @Controller is another kind of request handler.
					To install it, define a <code class="code">FlowHandlerAdapter</code> bean inside <code class="code">mvc-config.xml</code>.
					The bean will be picked up by the Spring MVC DispatcherServlet automatically.
				</p><p>
					The second adapter creates resource URL mappings to flows from the contents of your flow-registry.
					For example, a flow registered with id <code class="code">rewards/newReward</code> will be mapped to the resource URL <code class="code">/rewards/newReward</code> automatically.
					To install this adapter, define a <code class="code">FlowHandlerMapping</code> bean at the top of the file.
					</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
							Note: be sure to order your FlowHandlerMapping <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> other handler mappings defined in your <code class="code">mvc-config.xml</code>.
							Ordering first allows flow mappings to be queried before mappings to other types of handlers such as Spring MVC @Controllers.
							Recall mappings are ordered in a chain, and if no mapping is found, the next one in the chain is tried until there is a match or the chain is exhausted.
						</p></td></tr></table></div><p>
                    </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
                            When using the <code class="code">mvc:annotation-driven</code> tag, handler mappings will be defined starting with order 0.  
                            As you cannot change the order of those mappings, make sure you give the FlowHandlerMapping an order of -1.
                        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
				</p><p>
					Now that the core Web Flow infrastructure and Spring MVC adapters have been set up, make sure your application re-deploys successfully.
					Once you have a successful deployment, return to the welcome page and select the New Reward link again.
					It will still fail with a 404 resource not found.
                    Even though flow mapping was attempted, no flow was found because you have not defined one yet.
                </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2922"></a>2.2.2.&nbsp;Create a New Reward flow from the flow definition template</h4></div></div></div><p>
					From here on out, the process of working with Spring Web Flow generally involves authoring your flow definitions, then registering them with the flow registry.
					Once registered, flows can be executed by accessing their resource URLs.
				</p><p>					
					A web flow is typically authored in a single XML file called a "flow definition".
					Each flow definition is typically packaged in its own working directory alongside its dependent resources such as JSP templates, message bundles, and other resources.
					In general, flow definitions should be organized functionally, similar to how you properly structure Java packages.
					To support automatic refresh of web content without redeployment, flows are typically packaged inside the /WEB-INF directory as well.
				</p><p>
					With these best practices in mind, consider the specific characteristics of the New Reward flow.
					This flow is part of the "rewards" functional module, which is distinct from the "accounts" module.
					A good name for this flow is "newReward", which describes the goal this flow helps the user accomplish.
					It makes sense, then, that this flow be created in its own directory within the "rewards" namespace.
					That is exactly what you will do in this step.
				</p><p>
					Create the New Reward flow definition within a <code class="filename">/WEB-INF/rewards/newReward</code> directory with the filename <code class="filename">newReward-flow.xml</code>.
					Use the following template to define a flow body with a single view state:
				</p><p>
					</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;flow xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow"
	  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow 
	  http://www.springframework.org/schema/webflow/spring-webflow-2.0.xsd"&gt;

    &lt;view-state id="enterDiningInformation"/&gt;

&lt;/flow&gt;				
					</pre><p>
				</p><p>
					After creating and saving the flow definition, try accessing the New Rewards link again.
					Confirm it fails again with a 404.
					New flows do not automatically get detected; they must be registered in the flow registry.
					Do that in the next step.
				</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e2946"></a>2.2.3.&nbsp;Register the New Reward flow</h4></div></div></div><p>
					In this step, you will register the New Reward flow, then verify it tries to startup when accessed.
				</p><p>
					Navigate to your flow-registry bean in webflow-config.xml.
					There, register your flow located at <code class="code">/WEB-INF/rewards/newReward/newReward-flow.xml</code>.
					Assign the flow the id <code class="code">rewards/newReward</code>.
					</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" src="images/tip.png"></td><th align="left">Tip</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
							First, try registering the flow individually using the flow-location element.
							After you get that working, try using the flow-location-pattern element to register all flow definitions for the application in one concise statement.
							When you try this, also set the base-path attribute to specify a file-path-pattern relative to a directory such as /WEB-INF.
						</p></td></tr></table></div><p>
				</p><p>
					Once you have registered the flow, select the New Reward link for a third time.
					You should see a 404 error for <code class="filename">enterDiningInformation.jsp</code> and a URL with an execution parameter.
					The flow was launched but the <code class="code">enterDiningInformation</code> view failed to render because there is no JSP yet.
					You have completed this lab.
					In the next lab, you will implement the real New Reward flow logic!
